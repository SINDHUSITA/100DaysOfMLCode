# Sentiment Analysis over a Restaurant Review data

As introduction to **NLP with machine learning**, This model classfies a given restaurant review as Positive or Negative review.

For this Binary Classification, I used the **Navie Bayes Algorithm** and implemented the **Bag of Words** approach

Though this algorithm gave lesser accuracy compared to other algoritms, it performed better with the examples that I tested the model with compared to the others.
