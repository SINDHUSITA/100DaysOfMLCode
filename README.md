# 100 Days Of ML Code

**Main target:** ***I will practise Machine Learning for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.***

My journey towards expertise in Machine Learning.
I decided to start a dedicated learning journey from today.
I needed some motivation during the lockdown and that is when I came across the #100DaysOfMLCode challenge.
I pledge to spend atleast an hour every day on machine learning for the next 100 days with all dedication and passion.

## Day 2
**Today's Progress:**
Implemented Decision Tree Regressor and Support Vector Regressor over a sample dataset. Also, I got an idea of how each of these works mathematically. 

**Link to work:**

[Model Selection and Evaluation](https://github.com/SINDHUSITA/100DaysOfMLCode/tree/master/Part%202%20-%20Regression/Section%2010%20-%20Evaluating%20Regression%20Models%20Performance/Practice)

**Thoughts:**
Feeling great as I completed the Part2, Regression, from the course that I am currently pursuing. A big thanks to the tutors @kirill_eremenko and @Hadelin_de_Ponteves who made the learning so simple and fun. Can't wait the begin the Part3, Classification.
 
## Day 3,4
For the first time, I took up a very common Regression Project (Boston House Price Prediction).
So far, I have built the model but, now working on improving the results.

Please do find time to review my code here and I am open for any advice.
https://github.com/SINDHUSITA/100DaysOfMLCode/tree/master/Part%202%20-%20Regression/House%20Prices%20Project

## Day 6,7
Brought my first project in Regression to a final shape and learned some evaluation metrics for Regression models. 
Very excited as I finally enrolled myself to "Machine Learning by Stanford University" course by 
@AndrewYNg

## Day 8
Yaay! I am now into week2 of #100DaysOfMLCode.
So far, I learned regression algorithms and analyzed them not only theoretically but also with mathematics, which I believe is one of the most interesting ways to learn ML.
Today, I worked on the basics of Logistic Regression.

## Day 9,10
Implemented one of the classic classification algorithms, Logistic Regression, with Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset from UCI.
Check it out here: [Breast Cancer Prediction](https://github.com/SINDHUSITA/Breast-Cancer-Prediction)

## Day 11,12
Analysed how the SVM classifier works. It is definitely one of the most complex yet, powerful algorithms one can come across. I had to read many articles to get the right gist of how a few of the kernel functions work. Links in the following thread.

Here are two good articles from which I could comprehend everything I needed to know before implementing Support Vector Machine:
[KdNuggets](https://kdnuggets.com/2016/06/select-support-vector-machine-kernels.html)

## Day 13
For some reason, the Naive Bayes Classifier has always been my favorite algorithmFace with tongue.  Today, I revised it and tried implementing a different type of problem using it.
One good thing in Machine Learning is Mathematics and I am enjoying it.

## Day 14
Implemented Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifier. It is the end of week 2 and also the end of 'Section: Classification' from my course!
Want to take up an interesting project based on Classification. Please share your suggestions.Smiling face with smiling eyes

## Day 15,16
Everything was so perfect until a friend of mine suggested to consider uploading solutions in #kaggle and checking where my model stands. It actually turned out to be a terrible model. I have been working on the same.

## Day 17-21
Worked on the famous 'Titanic survival prediction'. 
Also, I am going to call this week 3 as **Kaggle** week. The whole week, I kept trying so hard to improve my model and advance in the leaderboard.

Check out my Kaggle profile: [Sindhu Inuganti - Kaggle](https://kaggle.com/sindhuinuganti)

## Day 22-25
Stepped into Unsupervised Learning and it is going great. 
Can't believe that it has been **25 days** since I started this. 
Looking forward to continuing for the rest 3 quarters with the same enthusiasm.

## Day 26-30
Taking baby steps into Deep Learning. There are numerous amazing resources available online just for free to help anyone get through this. I found #Coursera and #fasiai to be very useful and of course #YouTube too.

## Day 31-36
Understanding how neural networks and deep learning work with the help of Coursera. Invested more time into theoretical concepts rather than practicing them. I am going to utilize this Week5 for practical knowledge and for getting comfortable with **TensorFlow.**

## Day 37,38
Learning **Computer Vision** Fundamentals with: [Hand Written Digit Recognizer](https://github.com/SINDHUSITA/Hand-Written-Digit-Recognizer) from famous MNIST data.
Working on improving results for a kaggle submission.
Also, explored how CNNs work.

**Link to work**:
[Digit Reconizer](https://github.com/SINDHUSITA/100DaysOfMLCode/tree/master/Deep%20Learning/Projects/Digit%20Recognizer)

**Thoughts**:
Had I trained the model with better data, the better would have been the Model's performance.

## Day 46
**Today's Progress**:
Introduction to NLP with machine learning. 
Understood what Tokenization, Bag of Words approach and how BERT works.
Implemented understanding of Bag of Words approach for Sentiment Analysis on Restarant Review Dataset.

**Link to work**:
[Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/SINDHUSITA/100DaysOfMLCode/tree/master/Part%207%20-%20Natural%20Language%20Processing)

**Thoughts**:
As introduction to **NLP with machine learning**, This model classfies a given restaurant review as Positive or Negative review.
For this Binary Classification, I used the **Navie Bayes Algorithm** and implemented the **Bag of Words** approach
Though this algorithm gave lesser accuracy compared to other algoritms, it performed better with the examples that I tested the model with compared to the others.

**Thoughts**: Still can't get over the amount of powerful and useful resources available online just for free.
Thanks to the wonderful Data Science community!

## Day 60-63:
**Days' Progress**:
Learning about **Time Series Prediction**. Got familiar with basics and jumped to try out a [guided project](https://www.coursera.org/projects/prophet-timeseries-prediction) in Coursera. This uni-variate project deals with forecasting the Avocado Prices in America based on previous years' prices. 
Understood about a model called Prophet developed by Facebook, which makaes Time series prediction very easy and informative.

**Link to work**:
[Time Series Forecasting for Avocado Prices](https://github.com/SINDHUSITA/100DaysOfMLCode/tree/master/Time%20Series%20-%20Avocado%20Pricing)

**Thoughts**:
The idea of doing guided projects felt bad for me. It is just like a code walk through which prevents the chances of exploring and learning.
However, though I couldn't get enough hands-on with time series, I practised more on the visualization techniques.
